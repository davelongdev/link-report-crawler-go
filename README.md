# Link Report Crawler

# Note - This Project is a Work in Progress.

## Summary

This is a command line application built with Go that crawls a web site and
prints a report to the console showing the number of links to each page on the
site.

The app sorts the links from highst number of links to the lowest number of links.

## Language Note

I originaly buit this project in JavaScript, but I'm also writing it in Go.

The JavaScript version is available [here](https://github.com/davelongdev/link-report-crawler).

## Build Process

I built this app by following the project guidelines on [boot.dev](https://boot.dev).

## Coming Soon

I plan to add some more functionality to this app in the near future.  Ideas for additional functionality:

- show outgoing links in a seperate category
- print output to a txt file or csv file.
